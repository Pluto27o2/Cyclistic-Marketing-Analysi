# Credit Risk Classification Using Machine Learning

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1. Background and Objective

In today‚Äôs financial industry, managing **credit risk** ‚Äî the potential for financial loss when a borrower fails to repay a debt ‚Äî is a critical function. To make lending decisions that are **fast, objective, and accurate**, financial institutions increasingly rely on **data-driven credit scoring models**, moving away from traditional manual assessment methods.

The central objective of this project is to **build a machine learning model** to classify credit customers into **five distinct risk groups**, based on their historical debt status and repayment behavior.

This multi-tiered classification is strategically important, as it enables financial institutions to:

- Tailor credit policies more precisely  
- Accelerate suitable loan approvals  
- Minimize exposure to default risk  
- Ensure fairness in lending decisions  

---

### 1.2. Approach

To achieve this objective, the project follows a three-stage scientific process:

#### 1. Data Preprocessing

- Data cleaning and feature engineering  
- **Numerical variables**: Log-transformed and imputed with medians where necessary  
- **Categorical variables**: One-hot encoded  
- **Class imbalance**: Addressed using **SMOTE** to improve representation of minority classes  

#### 2. Model Development and Training

Six classification models were implemented and compared:

- **Traditional model**:  
  - Logistic Regression ‚Äî valued for interpretability  

- **Tree-based models**:  
  - Decision Tree  
  - Random Forest  
  - LightGBM ‚Äî efficient and high-performing  

- **Advanced models**:  
  - CatBoost  
  - Neural Network ‚Äî deep learning-based exploration  

All models were trained on **SMOTE-balanced data** using a **stratified train-test split**.

#### 3. Model Evaluation and Selection

Models were evaluated on a **hold-out test set** using the following metrics:

- Accuracy  
- Precision  
- Recall  
- F1-score  
- Confusion Matrix  

Special attention was given to **class-wise performance** and the **distribution of predicted classes**.  
**LightGBM** achieved the best trade-off between **accuracy** and **minority class detection**, making it the most suitable for deployment.
